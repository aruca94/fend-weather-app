## General Information
This project is to show compentancy working with apis and async JavaScript in applications. This is project 3 in my NanoDegree course by Udacity. The web app consists of a simple layout with two inputs. These inputs being: How are you feeling today, and what is your Zipcode. Once those two inputs are filled in and submitted by clicking the generate button, that information is then quarried with the openweather.org api to return weather data about the zipcode entered in a box below the inputs. Along with weather temperature, the current date is returned, as well as "how are you feeling".
